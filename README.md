# Cloud Journey (Public Proof Log)

**Why I'm here**
I’m transitioning into cloud to build a durable career, solve real problems, and create options for my family.

**My Focus (next 90 days)**
- AWS foundations (IAM, S3, EC2, CloudWatch)
- IaC with Terraform
- Documenting every build (README, screenshots, LinkedIn)

**Week 1 – Identity & First Wins**
- Set up GitHub + LinkedIn for cloud visibility
- Wrote this public proof log
- Next up: S3 + IAM “Public Access Problem” lab

**Projects (live/soon)**

**How I document**
Each project includes: problem → approach → commands/code → screenshots → lessons learned → what I'd do differently.

**Contact/Connect**
- LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/sean-orrett
- Notes: If you’re hiring for junior cloud/security roles, I’m documenting proof every week.
